<p>Hey, I'm James from Long Island, New York! I just got from my mission in French Polynesia a few months ago.
    I speak French and Tahitian and I love learning languages. I have a goal of learning a new language a year. Right now I am focusing mostly on Portuguese and a little bit of Spanish.
    I'm a marketing major. When I am not in school, I love playing pickleball and video games.
    I play Super Smash Brothers competitively. There are regular events on campus so if that's also your thing, I would love to show you!
